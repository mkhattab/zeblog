I'm software developer using mostly [Python](https://www.python.org)
for work and pleasure, but mostly work. If I'm not using Python, then
usually I'm writing
[Emacs Lisp (Elisp)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp) and
endlessly customizing my Emacs configuration --- which is quite normal
for Emacsers.

Most of work is web development; Python, Django and Flask. Also, I'm
quite passionate about [FreeSWITCH](http://freeswitch.org/) and VOIP.
I've built several sites integrating web applications with FreeSWITCH
via [Plivo](https://plivo.com/open-source/), e.g. click-to-call, web
phone (via Flash RTMP), etc.
