I'm a software developer using mostly [Python](https://www.python.org)
for work and pleasure, but mostly work. If I'm not using Python, then
usually I'm writing
[Emacs Lisp (Elisp)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp) and
endlessly customizing my Emacs configuration --- which is quite normal
for Emacsers.

Most of work is spent doing freelance web development; Python, Django
and Flask. Also, I'm quite passionate about
[FreeSWITCH](http://freeswitch.org/) and VOIP. I've built several
sites integrating web applications with FreeSWITCH via
[Plivo](https://plivo.com/open-source/), implementing features such as
click-to-call, web phone (via Flash RTMP), real-time billing, etc.
